1. Start by applying solder paste to the SMD parts pads. If you're using the solder mask, this should be easier and faster.
1. Place all SMD parts following guidance below.
1. Reflow ("Bake") the board.
1. Check for any bridges in the solder before continuing.
1. Place through hole components and solder them. the order is not important.
