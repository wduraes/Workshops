# Workshops at Snoco Makerspace

Hello, here you'll find all my workshop collateral. As a volunteer workshop host at Snoco Makerspace I get to create some content that might be useful not only to people attending these workshops but rather a bigger community. 

The list grows on demand and with the recent shift to online events, having a place to store all the collateral became even more important.

**Current list of Workshops I host:**

- Arduino 101
- Arduino 102
- Arduino Baremetal (Barebones)
- Electronics 101
- IoT 101
- IoT 102 - MQTT
- IoT 103 - end to end
- PCB 101
- SMD Soldering
- Logic Analyzer
- VS Code + Git for Makers


## Where can I find the workshop schedule?

At Snoco Makerspace we use Meetup to schedule all out Workshops. 

Please visit this link to find the most updated information: [https://www.meetup.com/SnoCo-Makers/events/](https://www.meetup.com/SnoCo-Makers/events/)

With several options for online Workshops, even if you don't live in the Snohomish county area (North of Seattle-WA) you may still be able to attend the workshops!

All the money generated by the workshops is used to help maintain the space and pay the bills. 

## Which workshop shoul I attend first?

You may attend workshops in any order, however, to maximize your learning experience some workshops should be taken in a specific order and others have pre-requisites. It all depends on your previous knowledge and interest for some specific topic. 

One suggestion would be to take the workshops in the following sequence:

 ![Learning Path](Images/path.png)

## Arduino 101

This is where everything starts! In the first workshop you’ll learn how to connect an Arduino board to your PC, basics of C++ to program it and control electronic components using code (a.k.a. blinking an LED). 

Impossible not to fall in love. 

## Electronics 101

Learn basic usage of a multimeter to measure power and components, a breadboard, the process to add new modules and components to the Arduino and expand the complexity of your projects. 

## Arduino Baremetal

How about creating your own project, without having to use an Arduino board? In this workshop you’ll learn how to take an ATMega328P (brain of the Arduino Uno) and get it to work in a breadboard. 

## PCB Design

Got your project up and running in a breadboard? This workshop is all about making it look professional and get a PCB (printed circuit board) done. Includes the schematics, the PCB design and good practices.

## SMD Soldering

Once you decide to move away from the breadboard, and design your own PCB, it is very likely you’ll use SMD components. In this workshop you’ll learn how to solder SMD parts usign the oven, a soldering irong and a SMD rework station. You'll also learn how to replace SMD components in a board

## Logic analyzer

Testing and troubleshooting more advanced circuits is hard. Buying an Oscilloscope might be an overkill, so come and learn how a Logic Analyzer can help you to understand, study and fix your projects!

## Visual Studio Code + Arduino

This is a workshop where you'll learn how to use the free VS Code to work with Arduino boards, replacing Arduino IDE. By adding free extensions on top of VS Code, writing C++ code was never that easy.

## IoT 101 

You heard of it, but what is IoT anyway and how can you, as a maker, benefit from it? In this workshop we cover the basics of IoT, then we take an inexpensive ESP8266 set it up on Arduino IDE, setup an online service for MQTT and get the device to send telemetry data and get commands from the cloud.

## IoT 201 

XXXXXX

## IoT 301 

Create and end to end solution based on Mosquitto (MQTT Broker), Node-Red (Workflow automation), InfluxDB (No SQL time series DB) and Grafana (UI and data visualization). All of them configured and installed in a Raspberry Pi computer!

## Coming soon:

We're always adding new titles to our Workshop list based on the new technologies, trends and by interest of Snoco Makers community. Next ones in the list* are:


**Micro Python** Modern and faster microcontrollers (> 80Mhz) allow for a core Python layer that interprets code and make your board behave like a flashdrive simplifying the porcess of upload new versions of your sketch to the device. During this workshop we'll be reviewing the ATSAMD Michrochip family (SAMD 21 and SAMD 51)

**Important** The list above is subject to change and, as per today, there is no planned date to release these titles
